hook regarding social injustices or PGHS

## Social justice advocacy

Psychological models: what does advocacy try to achieve? How? Introduce potential mediators

increase empathy: motivation, rather than skill, to emphasize (Weisz & Zaki, 2017)

## Artistic responses

film vs. music: explanatory portrayal vs. experiential immersion approach to advocate for social justice issues â€“\> film could increase reasoned awareness, music could increase perspective-taking/empathy

music has been related to closeness

## Collective aspects

in-person event: social contagion/collective action with performers (music only) or audience members (film and music) could enhance effects

## Citations

See [here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html) for instructions on setting up citations and references.

A parenthetical citation requires square brackets [@CameronTrivedi2013]. This reference was in my bibliography file. An in-text citation is done like so:

@CameronTrivedi2013 make some important points ...

See [here](https://wjschne.github.io/apaquarto/writing.html#references) for explanations, examples, and citation features exclusive to apaquarto. For example, apaquarto can automatically handle possessive citations:

@schneider2012cattell ['s] position was ...

## Masking Author Identity for Peer Review

Setting `mask` to `true` will remove author names, affiliations, and correspondence from the title page. Any references listed in the `masked-citations` field will be masked as well. See [here](https://wjschne.github.io/apaquarto/writing.html#masked-citations-for-anonymous-peer-review) for more information.

## Block Quotes

Sometimes you want to give a longer quote that needs to go in its own paragraph. Block quotes are on their own line starting with the \> character. For example, @austenMansfieldPark1990 ['s] *Mansfield Park* has some memorable insights about the mind:

> If any one faculty of our nature may be called more wonderful than the rest, I do think it is memory. There seems something more speakingly incomprehensible in the powers, the failures, the inequalities of memory, than in any other of our intelligences. The memory is sometimes so retentive, so serviceable, so obedient; at others, so bewildered and so weak; and at others again, so tyrannic, so beyond control! We are, to be sure, a miracle every way; but our powers of recollecting and of forgetting do seem peculiarly past finding out. (p. 163)

## Math and Equations

Inline math uses $\LaTeX$ syntax with single dollar signs. For example, the reliability coefficient of my measure is $r_{XX}=.95$.

If you want to display and refer to a specific formula, enclose the formula in two dollar signs. After the second pair of dollar signs, place the label in curly braces. The label should have an `#eq-` prefix. To refer to the formula, use the same label but with the `@` symbol. For example, @eq-euler is Euler's Identity, which is much admired for its elegance.

$$
e^{i\pi}+1=0
$$ {#eq-euler}

A more practical example is the z-score equation seen in @eq-zscore.

$$
z=\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}
$$ {#eq-zscore}

If no identifier label is given, a centered equation in display mode will have no identifying number:

$$
\sigma_e=\sigma_y\sqrt{1-r_{xy}^2}
$$

## Displaying Figures

Do you want the tables and figures to be at the end of the document? You can set the `floatsintext` option to false. The reference labels will work no matter where they are in the text.

A reference label for a figure must have the prefix `fig-`, and in a code chunk, the caption must be set with `fig-cap`. Captions are in [title case](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/capitalization/title-case).

```{r}
#| label: fig-myplot
#| fig-cap: The Figure Caption
#| apa-note: This is the note below the figure.
#| fig-height: 2
#| fig-width: 3
ggplot(data.frame(x = c(0, 35)), aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dchisq, 
                args = list(df = 10),
                geom = "area",
                n = 1000,
                color = NA,
                fill = "#41448780") +
  theme_void(base_size = 18)
```

To refer to any figure or table, use the `@` symbol followed by the reference label (e.g., @fig-myplot).

## Displaying Tables

We can make a table the same way as a figure. Generating a table that conforms to APA format in all document formats can be tricky. When the table is simple, the `kable` function from knitr works well. Feel free to experiment with different methods, but I have found that David Gohel's [flextable](https://davidgohel.github.io/flextable/) to be the best option when I need something more complex.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-mytable
#| tbl-cap: The Table Caption. 
#| apa-note: The note below the table.
tibble(Numbers = seq(1,4), Letters = LETTERS[seq(Numbers)]) %>%
  knitr::kable()

```

To refer to this table in text, use the `@` symbol followed by the reference label like so: As seen in @tbl-mytable, the first few numbers and letters of the alphabet are displayed.

## Footnotes

A footnote is usually displayed at the bottom of the page on which the footnote occurs. A short note can be specified with the `^[My note here]` syntax.[^1] A longer note can be specified with the `[^id]` syntax with the text specified on a separate line like so `[^id]: Text here`.[^2]

[^1]: Here is my short footnote!

[^2]: This is a longer footnote. If it has multiple paragraphs, subsequent paragraphs need to be indented with two tabs.

    This paragraph is still part of the footnote because it is indented with two tabs.

A regular paragraph without any indentation is not part of the footnote and will be part of the main body of the document.

## Hypotheses, Aims, and Objectives

The last paragraph of the introduction usually states the specific hypotheses of the study, often in a way that links them to the research design.

# Method

General remarks on method. This paragraph is optional.

Not all papers require each of these sections. Edit them as needed. Consult the [Journal Article Reporting Standards](https://apastyle.apa.org/jars) for what is needed for your type of article.

## Participants

Who are they? How were they recruited? Report criteria for participant inclusion and exclusion. Perhaps some basic demographic stats are in order. A table is a great way to avoid repetition in statistical reporting.

## Measures

This section can also be titled **Materials** or **Apparatus**. Whatever tools, equipment, or measurement devices used in the study should be described.

### Measure A

Describe Measure A.

### Measure B

Describe Measure B.

#### Subscale B1

A paragraph after a 4th-level header will appear on the same line as the header.

#### Subscale B2

A paragraph after a 4th-level header will appear on the same line as the header.

##### Subscale B2a

A paragraph after a 5th-level header will appear on the same line as the header.

##### Subscale B2b

A paragraph after a 5th-level header will appear on the same line as the header.

## Procedure

What did participants do? How are the data going to be analyzed?

# Results

## Descriptive Statistics

Describe the basic characteristics of the primary variables. My ideal is to describe the variables well enough that someone conducting a meta-analysis can include the study without needing to ask for additional information.

<!-- Add Additional Sections as Needed -->

@tbl-mymarkdowntable2 is an example of a plain markdown table. Note the that the caption begins with a colon.

| Letters | Numbers |
|:-------:|:-------:|
|    A    |    1    |
|    B    |    2    |
|    C    |    3    |

: My Caption. {#tbl-mymarkdowntable2 apa-note="My note"}

# Discussion

Describe results in non-statistical terms. <!-- Add sections as needed. -->

## Limitations and Future Directions

Every study has limitations. Based on this study, some additional steps might include...

## Conclusion

Describe the main point of the paper.

# My Appendix Title {#apx-a}

Appendices are created as level 1 headings with an identifier with an `#apx-` prefix. Appendix titles should be in title case and should describe the content of the appendix.

If there is only one appendix, the label automatically inserted above the the appendix title will be **Appendix**. If there are multiple appendices, the labels **Appendix A**, **Appendix B**, **Appendix C** and so forth will be inserted above the titles.

To cite an appendix as a whole, reference it with the `@apx-` prefix. For example, see @apx-a and @apx-b.

This is an appendix with a table using markdown (see @tbl-letters).

| Col 1 | Col 2 | Col 3 |
|-------|-------|-------|
| A     | B     | C     |
| E     | F     | G     |
| A     | G     | G     |

: My Caption {#tbl-letters apa-note="These are letters."}

# Another Appendix {#apx-b}
