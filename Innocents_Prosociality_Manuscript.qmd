Despite our shared struggle for a better world, societies remain unjust. For example, criminal justice systems were implemented to ensure a just society, but across governments, systemic issues lead to the wrongful imprisonment of innocent individuals. How do we mobilize support to fight social injustice such as wrongful imprisonment? Arts and media are a way of reaching and engaging broad audiences. Theatre, soap operas, and film, using the power of storytelling, can shape attitudes and behaviours with regards to social injustice. Music is also commonly used to advocate for social justice issues, for instance in the forms of charity concerts and protest songs. While previous research has uncovered how music shapes our evaluation of the people making the music or listening to it, few studies have investigated how music influences our views of people and issues that are the subject of music. Given that music typically has less narration than the previously studied media, it remains unclear how socially responsible music promotes audiences' engagement with social justice issues. In addition, theories of prosocial behaviour and social engagement put forward various predictors that could explain how arts and media can advocate for social justice issues. This plurality makes it difficult for researchers to integrate previous works, and for artists to understand which factors are decisive to effectively engage their audience.

Here, we evaluate how a music performance engages audiences with the issue of wrongful imprisonment, compared to a more narrative documentary film. We assess changes in three affective and cognitive variables, empathic concern, relationship closeness, and problem awareness, and compare their influence on audiences' supportive behaviour. This study provides empirical support for the mobilizing potential of music as a medium with less narration, and highlights which facet of audiences' attitudes artists should appeal to in order to gain support for their cause.

## Mobilizing support for social justice causes

<!-- Psychological models: what does advocacy try to achieve? How? Introduce potential mediators -->

The aim of social justice advocacy is to foster engagement with a social justice issue and mobilize supportive behaviour for that cause. Various psychological theories attempt to explain behaviour and could be applicable in the context of social justice advocacy. This plurality hinders theory integration across studies of socially responsible behaviour. It is therefore necessary to empirically compare the relevance of different theories and constructs for predicting the behaviour of interest [TODO CITE THAT REVIEW]. In this study, we compare normative, empathic, and relational predictors. The following paragraphs will review the respective theoretical backgrounds, explaining support for social justice causes within the framework of the norm activation model [NAM; @schwartz1977], the empathy-altruism hypothesis [@batson1987], and the theory of bounded generalized reciprocity [@yamagishi1999].

Justice is a moral concept, and fighting injustices or supporting social justice causes can be conceived as morally-driven behaviour. The NAM lays out the process of how personal norms create a moral obligation to act. According to the model, an actor first has to become aware of a problematic situation like wrongful imprisonment, resulting in the knowledge that the current conditions of the situation will cause negative consequences for a person in need, like innocent prisoners. Subsequently, the actor evaluates their responsibility for the problem, coming to the conclusion that they can change the conditions to avert the negative consequences. As a third component, the problem must be relevant to the personal norms of the actor, like a just legal system or fighting injustices, so that the norms are activated and guide the behaviour in the situation. In combination, problem awareness, ascription of responsibility, and personal norms create a moral obligation for the actor to help solve the problem, thus acting in accordance with their norms [@schwartz1977; @degroot2009]. Importantly, the NAM postulates a causal chain of the three components, which explains why we do not always behave normatively: If we are not aware of a problem or we do not believe that we can change it, our norms do not activate in that situation and therefore do not guide our behaviour [although the empirical evidence regarding the causal chain is mixed; @klöckner2013].

Many studies [e.g., @savari2023; @degroot2009; @steg2010] integrate the NAM with the theory of planned behaviour [TPB; @ajzen1991; @ajzen2011]. While there is some conceptual overlap between the normative and belief components of the NAM and the TPB, the TPB contributes the behavioural intention as the most proximal predictor of behaviour. The idea is that rational (or planned) behaviour is necessarily preceded by a decision to engage in that behaviour. Therefore, all other determinants of behaviour influence this decision, which mediates the actual behaviour [@ajzen1991; @ajzen2011]. Separating intention and behaviour reduces noise in the analysis, because the translation of intention into behaviour can be hindered by external factors beyond the scope of studying what motivates actors to engage in a behaviour [e.g., lack of resources or unexpected situations; @sheeran2002]. In conclusion, social justice advocacy can mobilize supportive behaviour by raising awareness for a problem, appealing to the responsibility of its audience, or strengthening norms regarding social justice, which contribute to the intention to support the social justice cause. However, problem awareness might have to precede the other components, especially when the social justice issue is lesser known.

Alternatively to the normative framing, supporting social justice causes can be understood as altruistically motivated behaviour. According to the empathy-altruism hypothesis, empathically adopting the perspective of a person in need creates an altruistic motivation to reduce their suffering. For example, by empathizing with the experience of an innocent prisoner, an actor becomes concerned about their well-being, and thus feels motivated to help to improve the well-being of the innocent prisoner [@batson1987; @batson2011]. There has been a long debate on whether helping behaviour is motivated by altruistic concern in the interest of the other person, or by the actor's self-interest to reduce their own distress arising from witnessing the other person's suffering [@batson2011; @cialdini1997]. Both empathic concern and personal distress, however, arise from empathic perspective-taking. *TODO add that empathizing is effortful, therefore motivate audiences to empathize (rather than improve their ability to empathize; Weisz & Zaki, 2017).* Hence, social justice advocacy can mobilize supportive behaviour by conveying the experiences and point of view of those affected by the social justice issue, thereby facilitating empathic responses from the audience.

Finally, supporting social justice causes might be motivated by group cohesion. If we perceive victims of social injustice as part of our ingroup, we are more likely to fight social injustice to help those group members.

<!-- Finally, supporting social justice causes might be motivated by expectations of reciprocity. Through the lens of interpersonal relations, we are more likely to help those closer to us because xyz [@yamagishi1999]. Therefore, social justice advocacy can mobilize supportive behaviour by increasing the perceived relationship closeness between audiences and those affected by the social justice issue, which the audience to help in return for reciprocity xyz. -->

## Artistic responses

film vs. music: narrative portrayal vs. experiential immersion approach to advocate for social justice issues –\> film could increase reasoned awareness, music could increase perspective-taking/empathy

music has been related to closeness

## Collective aspects

in-person event: social contagion/collective action with performers (music only) or audience members (film and music) could enhance effects

## Citations

See [here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html) for instructions on setting up citations and references.

A parenthetical citation requires square brackets [@CameronTrivedi2013]. This reference was in my bibliography file. An in-text citation is done like so:

@CameronTrivedi2013 make some important points ...

See [here](https://wjschne.github.io/apaquarto/writing.html#references) for explanations, examples, and citation features exclusive to apaquarto. For example, apaquarto can automatically handle possessive citations:

## Masking Author Identity for Peer Review

Setting `mask` to `true` will remove author names, affiliations, and correspondence from the title page. Any references listed in the `masked-citations` field will be masked as well. See [here](https://wjschne.github.io/apaquarto/writing.html#masked-citations-for-anonymous-peer-review) for more information.

## Block Quotes

Sometimes you want to give a longer quote that needs to go in its own paragraph. Block quotes are on their own line starting with the \> character. For example, @austenMansfieldPark1990 ['s] *Mansfield Park* has some memorable insights about the mind:

> If any one faculty of our nature may be called more wonderful than the rest, I do think it is memory. There seems something more speakingly incomprehensible in the powers, the failures, the inequalities of memory, than in any other of our intelligences. The memory is sometimes so retentive, so serviceable, so obedient; at others, so bewildered and so weak; and at others again, so tyrannic, so beyond control! We are, to be sure, a miracle every way; but our powers of recollecting and of forgetting do seem peculiarly past finding out. (p. 163)

## Math and Equations

Inline math uses $\LaTeX$ syntax with single dollar signs. For example, the reliability coefficient of my measure is $r_{XX}=.95$.

If you want to display and refer to a specific formula, enclose the formula in two dollar signs. After the second pair of dollar signs, place the label in curly braces. The label should have an `#eq-` prefix. To refer to the formula, use the same label but with the `@` symbol. For example, @eq-euler is Euler's Identity, which is much admired for its elegance.

$$
e^{i\pi}+1=0
$$ {#eq-euler}

A more practical example is the z-score equation seen in @eq-zscore.

$$
z=\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}
$$ {#eq-zscore}

If no identifier label is given, a centered equation in display mode will have no identifying number:

$$
\sigma_e=\sigma_y\sqrt{1-r_{xy}^2}
$$

## Displaying Figures

Do you want the tables and figures to be at the end of the document? You can set the `floatsintext` option to false. The reference labels will work no matter where they are in the text.

A reference label for a figure must have the prefix `fig-`, and in a code chunk, the caption must be set with `fig-cap`. Captions are in [title case](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/capitalization/title-case).

```{r}
#| label: fig-myplot
#| fig-cap: The Figure Caption
#| apa-note: This is the note below the figure.
#| fig-height: 2
#| fig-width: 3
ggplot(data.frame(x = c(0, 35)), aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dchisq, 
                args = list(df = 10),
                geom = "area",
                n = 1000,
                color = NA,
                fill = "#41448780") +
  theme_void(base_size = 18)
```

To refer to any figure or table, use the `@` symbol followed by the reference label (e.g., @fig-myplot).

## Displaying Tables

We can make a table the same way as a figure. Generating a table that conforms to APA format in all document formats can be tricky. When the table is simple, the `kable` function from knitr works well. Feel free to experiment with different methods, but I have found that David Gohel's [flextable](https://davidgohel.github.io/flextable/) to be the best option when I need something more complex.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-mytable
#| tbl-cap: The Table Caption. 
#| apa-note: The note below the table.
tibble(Numbers = seq(1,4), Letters = LETTERS[seq(Numbers)]) %>%
  knitr::kable()

```

To refer to this table in text, use the `@` symbol followed by the reference label like so: As seen in @tbl-mytable, the first few numbers and letters of the alphabet are displayed.

## Footnotes

A footnote is usually displayed at the bottom of the page on which the footnote occurs. A short note can be specified with the `^[My note here]` syntax.[^1] A longer note can be specified with the `[^id]` syntax with the text specified on a separate line like so `[^id]: Text here`.[^2]

[^1]: Here is my short footnote!

[^2]: This is a longer footnote. If it has multiple paragraphs, subsequent paragraphs need to be indented with two tabs.

    This paragraph is still part of the footnote because it is indented with two tabs.

A regular paragraph without any indentation is not part of the footnote and will be part of the main body of the document.

## Hypotheses, Aims, and Objectives

The last paragraph of the introduction usually states the specific hypotheses of the study, often in a way that links them to the research design.

# Method

# Results

## Descriptive Statistics

Describe the basic characteristics of the primary variables. My ideal is to describe the variables well enough that someone conducting a meta-analysis can include the study without needing to ask for additional information.

# My Appendix Title {#apx-a}

Appendices are created as level 1 headings with an identifier with an `#apx-` prefix. Appendix titles should be in title case and should describe the content of the appendix.

If there is only one appendix, the label automatically inserted above the the appendix title will be **Appendix**. If there are multiple appendices, the labels **Appendix A**, **Appendix B**, **Appendix C** and so forth will be inserted above the titles.

To cite an appendix as a whole, reference it with the `@apx-` prefix. For example, see @apx-a and @apx-b.

This is an appendix with a table using markdown (see @tbl-letters).

| Col 1 | Col 2 | Col 3 |
|-------|-------|-------|
| A     | B     | C     |
| E     | F     | G     |
| A     | G     | G     |
