## Abstract
When advocating for social justice, music is commonly used to rally support for justice-seeking groups. Music has been shown to increase prosocial behaviour like cooperation and helping, but this effect has mostly been investigated among the individuals involved in the music experience. It is thus unclear how music can foster prosociality towards external groups. Music can strengthen social bonding or empathic concern, which could facilitate prosociality, but might require shared co-presence. Alternatively, prosociality could emerge from problem awareness, but we lack empirical evidence as to whether music can effectively raise awareness for a specific issue. Here, we investigate the role of bonding, empathy, and awareness in social justice advocacy through music. 

We organized a charity event featuring a documentary film and a percussion performance about wrongful imprisonment, shown in counterbalanced order. 94 audience members attending in-person or in a livestream reported their awareness of wrongful imprisonment, bonding and empathy with those affected, and intentions to support a relevant charity, before and after each presentation. At the end of the event, we assessed charitable behaviour. 

The event increased bonding, empathy, and awareness of in-person and livestream audiences. Comparing performance and film, both had a similar effect on empathy and awareness, while the film afforded steeper increases in bonding. Notably, seeing both media in succession had an additive effect on all three variables. Two-thirds of participants performed one or more charitable behaviours, predicted by behavioural intentions. Intentions did not change significantly throughout the event but were predicted by empathy. 

In conclusion, live and livestreamed charity concerts can foster empathy for external justice-seeking groups to rally support for their fight for justice. The results of this study contribute to the interdisciplinary scholarship on prosociality and directly inform the design of musical experiences that advocate for social justice.
